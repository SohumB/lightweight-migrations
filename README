This is a very quick and hackish lightweight approach to migrations for sql
schema stored in git repositories.

./install.sh <your git repo> will create the directory structure you need in
your git repository.

It tries to do the right thing with regard to relative paths, git roots, and the
repository initial state. It explicitly does not try to do the right thing for
branching schema or rewinding, which are hard and make me want to go
shopping. Also, there are probably better ways to install a project like this
that maintain repository-ness. *Also*, realistically idempotent sql change
scripts tend to be ugly and very unDRY. Let's just say that This Can Be
Improved.

Be sure to also read maintenance/README and to create maintenance/run_sql after
you've installed this.

Only depends on git, /bin/sh, and the existence of /dev/null.
